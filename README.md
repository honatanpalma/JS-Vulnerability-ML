# JavaScript Vulnerability Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Description

This project employs a Random Forest model trained on code features to predict potential vulnerabilities in JavaScript, providing a foundational understanding of machine learning applications in code security. 

## Dataset

* **JSVulnerabilityDataSet-1.0.csv:** Contains features extracted from JavaScript code and a binary label indicating the presence or absence of vulnerabilities. 
* **Data Source:** The dataset is sourced from [http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~ferenc/papers/JSVulnerabilityDataSet/](http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~ferenc/papers/JSVulnerabilityDataSet/)

## Workflow

The KNIME workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Data Input:** Reads the dataset.
2. **Preprocessing:** Handles missing values and selects relevant features.
3. **Rule Engine:** Creates a nominal column for stratified sampling.
4. **Partitioning:** Splits the data into training and test sets using stratified sampling.
5. **Random Forest Learner:** Trains a Random Forest model on the training data.
6. **Random Forest Predictor:** Applies the model to the test data for predictions.
7. **Scorer:** Evaluates the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## How to Run

* **Download from KNIME Hub:** The workflow can be downloaded directly from the KNIME Community Hub.
* **View on KNIME Hub:** You can also visualize the workflow online at [https://hub.knime.com/-/spaces/-/~wWHTgRJIGutbxkD-/current-state/](https://hub.knime.com/-/spaces/-/~wWHTgRJIGutbxkD-/current-state/)
* **Local Execution:**
